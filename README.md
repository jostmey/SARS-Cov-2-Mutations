###### JARED L OSTMEYER, ASSISTANT PROFESSOR, UT SOUTHWESTERN DEPARTMENT OF POPULATION AND DATA SCIENCES

## Rebuild Database

To rebuild the database, we need to first download available versions of the SARS-Cov-2 genome. Visit https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/vssi and click `Seach by virus`. In the search box type `SARS-Cov-2` and click on `taxid:2697049`. A new page will appepar with the list of genome sequences.

## Requirements

* [Python3](https://www.python.org/)
* [Biopython version 1.7.1](https://biopython.org/)
